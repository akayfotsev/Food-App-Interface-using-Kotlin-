Created a functional food app with features like navigating through different screens, selecting and adding food items to the cart, increasing and decreasing the amount of food items to be ordered in the cart, reading descriptions about the food item, with weekly special dishes card and menu item card and also some animations while booting the app. Used kotlin and android's UI toolkit "Jetpack Compose" for making the app. This app has been built natively in Android.
